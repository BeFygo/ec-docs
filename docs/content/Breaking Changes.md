#  :boom: Recent Breaking Changes

* `v7.0.0` The configuration entry for stay mode was renamed from `stay` to `stay_mode`. Entity services have been renamed as well for consistency (see docs) [PR #176](https://github.com/danobot/entity-controller/pull/176), [Issue #143](https://github.com/danobot/entity-controller/issues/143).
* `v6.0.0` introduces a breaking change if you are relying on the entities `friendly_name` in other automations. See [#153](https://github.com/danobot/entity-controller/pull/153). The release PR is [#156](https://github.com/danobot/entity-controller/pull/156).
