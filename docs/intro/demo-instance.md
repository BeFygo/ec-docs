# Demo instance

I created a demo instance which (over time) will showcase all the different EC features. 

[Demo Instance](https://ec-demo.danielbkr.net)

**Browser login (Basic Auth)**
```      
Username:                 test
Password:                 ecdemo
```
**Home Assistant Login**
```
Username:                 github
Password:                 W8VfFdKU2zvS3GHV
```

This instance may not be available at all times. Do not raise issues for this. All the confugration is available in the `hass-demo` directory.
